# Giving and Receiving feedback

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Give effective feedback
* Receive feedback effectively

Feedback is extremely important, as it is an opportunity to improve performance, motivate yourself or others, and strengthen working relationships. Its goal is to foster growth and development, and **NOT** a chance to complain about or belittle the recipient. Despite this, feedback can also create a tense situation as it can be nerve-racking trying to avoid offending your teammates. Alternatively, it can be equally difficult not to take feedback from others too personally. 

To resolve this issue it is important to have a growth mindset about accepting and receiving criticism. A **growth mindset** emphasizes that an individual may not have reached their performance goal yet, but they will be able to get there in the future. Feedback is therefore not something to feel self-conscious about, but instead a tool that everyone needs to help them achieve their goals. 
"The mistake itself is never the problem. What can be problematic is rather the communication about the mistake: It is just as problematic to limit oneself to naming the problem - and arguing only at the task level - as it is to not name it at all" Hattie/Zierer, 10 Mindframes for Visible Learning: Teaching for Success (p. 92).

There are three basic types of feedback:

**Recognition feedback** focuses on acknowledging what people are doing right. It should recognize specific contributions or qualities that are appreciated, and be more than just a general thank you. Recognition feedback makes teammates feel valued, and as a result, increases their overall productivity.

**Developmental feedback** gives the recipient guidance on how to improve or get past performance or behavioral issues. Once the problem is identified, the recipient and issuer work together to map out strategies for continued growth and improvement. This not only helps their professional development but also gives teammates a better understanding of their importance or value in the organization.

**Performance feedback** measures people against direct expectations, such as a rubric. This is an opportunity to provide recipients with clarity and reassurance as to how they are doing within the team.  By creating clear and specific targets, both parties have factual evidence to determine the team member’s overall performance level. Take care not to sugarcoat this type of feedback, as complete clarity is required for understanding and trust.

## Tips for Improving Feedback Quality

* **If possible, have feedback discussions in a timely and planned out manner.**
Feedback should occur soon after the critiqued performance or behavior occurs, but still allow enough time for you to plan out what you want to say in a well-thought-out manner. As such, always make sure you have calmed down prior to giving feedback at the end of a pairing session. Conversely, if you are the one receiving feedback, take some time to reflect on what you have been told before immediately responding. Agree upon a time to discuss feedback with others in advance- this will help to ensure both parties are ready to enter the conversation with a clear mind.

* **Encourage feedback to occur on a regular cadence for your entire team.**
By making feedback and expectation on a regular basis, much of the taboo and pressure of criticism is removed. This will allow everyone on the team the opportunity to grow and develop alongside their peers. Feedback is a common agile practice, and you will be giving and receiving it frequently when you join a programming team in the “real world.”

* **Ensure feedback has specific examples and areas of improvement.**
This gives the recipient a clear measurement of how they can grow in future feedback sessions. If you know of specific personal goals the recipient has, tie your feedback to those

* **Avoid giving judgemental feedback.**
**Self-regulation** is controlling your own thoughts and actions. It is important to employ self-regulation when giving feedback, and carefully consider your words during a feedback session. Focus on observable behavior only, without giving any bias or suggested intent. This will help prevent the recipient from becoming defensive or making developmental feedback too personal.

* **For non-major issues, include recognition feedback alongside developmental feedback.**
Recognition feedback is important too! It is often difficult to avoid focusing on the negative traits a person displays that we want to see fixed, all the while ignoring the many other things that are going well. This not only helps cushion the blow of developmental feedback, but also gives the recipient a clear idea of where their current strengths lie within the team.

* **Words have meaning, so choose them carefully.**
Take the time to ensure your words reflect what you want to say, and limit the opportunity for misunderstanding. Always make sure you are in a calm state when providing feedback, and phrase your words in ways that inspire growth, rather than causing discouragement.

* **Is your feedback meeting in person, virtual, or in writing?**
Be cognizant of physical clues and context, as it is more difficult to communicate clearly when not in the same space as the recipient. Written feedback is void of the body language, tone, and social cues verbal feedback provides. Virtual feedback, on the other hand, can have plenty of outside distractions, so ensure that both parties are in an appropriate time and space for the feedback to occur. Having your camera on is important during virtual communication!
