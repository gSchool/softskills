* Understand the basics of technical writing and communication

## Overview

If you’re going to be working on a team with other people, it is vital that you are able to communicate effectively. This means having a good relationship with other members of your team, as well as being able to get your point across clearly and concisely. To achieve these goals, you need to be approachable, interested, and authentic.

## Approachable

To achieve effective communication, you need to be approachable. This means making a conscientious effort to engage with the people around you and working to make deeper connections with them. When a relationship is new you should seek to relate to the person on a base level, such as mentioning the difficulty of the assignment you worked on last night or talking about the latest sporting event. Whatever the opening topic, try to tailor it to the interests of the person you are interacting with. As you get to know them better, make a mental note of specific interests or hobbies they may mention. This will cause your greetings and side interactions to be much more personal, and improve the impression people have of you.

## Interested

To form connections with others, you need to show an active interest in what they are communicating to you. The most obvious indication of a person giving you their full attention comes from their body language, so make sure to show good listening skills. Make eye contact with whomever you are speaking with, avoid any distracting activities such as typing or looking at your phone, and pay attention to their facial expressions and gestures so that you can react accordingly.

It is also important to engage in the conversation and ask questions to show that you’re truly interested. Starting out with simple, easy-to-answer questions is a great way to increase the comfort level of the speaker, and then you can move into deeper questions as the conversation goes on. Once the conversation has fully developed, you can demonstrate your understanding further by paraphrasing the other person’s ideas. This not only makes those you are speaking to feel fully heard, but it also allows them to correct any misunderstandings you may have.

## Authentic

“Authenticity… involves two parts: (a) who we say we are  and (b) what we do.” As such, you need to back up your words with your actions. This means taking great care in what you do and say to others.” - Better Conversations, Jim Knight, 2015

While you definitely want to be empathetic in a conversation, it is equally important to be open and honest.  People need to know they can trust what you are saying to them in order to fully engage with your ideas. This can be especially difficult when you find yourself disagreeing with someone else’s ideas, or if they take offense to any feedback you provide to them. 

The key in these situations is to remain assertive without being aggressive. Maintain neutral or positive body language, and focus on staying calm and non-threatening throughout the interaction. It is okay to negotiate, but always ensure that your idea is openly expressed. Clearly state your point of view, and remember to stay respectful but firm - being over apologetic or backpedaling creates uncertainty in the conversation. However, don’t confuse being firm with keeping an open mind- listen carefully to what the other person has to say in the conversation and feel free to change your mind- just ensure that your positions are readily apparent while you do so.  Also, be sure to avoid blaming others throughout the discussion- owning your ideas allows you to keep your credibility. Following these guidelines will ensure that the group can reach a workable solution- even if it’s more difficult in the short term.


## Technical Writing

As a programmer, it is important to learn how to keep your thoughts succinct and to the point when communicating with others. Keep the following tips in mind to effectively communicate with others.

**Keep in mind what the recipient already knows.**
When talking with someone, it can be difficult to avoid summarizing information they’ve likely already acquired from somewhere else. Avoiding this mistake not only saves everyone time, but also keeps the recipient’s attention focused on the most important part of your conversation. That being said, make certain not to skip over key ideas they may not have heard already. Think ahead about what they most likely already know, and don’t be afraid to ask if they know about a topic if you’re unsure.


**Discuss your ideas in an engaging manner.**
Communication is amplified when the recipient actively engages with what you are saying to them. If you know the person you are talking to well enough, try to relate the information to something they are familiar with. Allow time for them to respond to what you are saying, and ask them to paraphrase your main points at the end of the conversation.

**If appropriate, use supporting imagery.**
As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. When trying to communicate a complex idea, an image such as a graph or flow chart could help to foster understanding. Always think about what information you want to convey, and decide if an image would help you make your point.

**Simplify your language.**
Fancy wording is great for coming across more eloquently, but avoid using unnecessarily complex words when simple terminology will work. Also be sure to stay away from acronyms unless you’re certain everyone in your group is fully familiar with the term. Sometimes a well orchestrated point can be lost when a recipient is distracted trying to piece together what certain words mean without coming across as uninformed- help them avoid that stress altogether by keeping it simple.
