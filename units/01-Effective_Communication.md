# Effective communication

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Communicate effectively with your teammate(s)
* Understand the basics of technical writing and communication

## Overview

If you’re going to be working on a team with other people, it is vital that you are able to communicate effectively. This means having a good relationship with other members of your team, as well as being able to get your point across clearly and concisely. To achieve these goals, you need to be approachable, interested, and authentic.

## Approachable

To achieve effective communication, you need to be approachable. This means making a conscientious effort to engage with the people around you and working to make deeper connections with them. When a relationship is new you should seek to relate to the person on a base level, such as mentioning the difficulty of the assignment you worked on last night or talking about the latest sporting event. Whatever the opening topic, try to tailor it to the interests of the person you are interacting with. As you get to know them better, make a mental note of specific interests or hobbies they may mention. This will cause your greetings and side interactions to be much more personal, and improve the impression people have of you.

## Interested

To form connections with others, you need to show an active interest in what they are communicating to you. The most obvious indication of a person giving you their full attention comes from their body language, so make sure to show good listening skills. Make eye contact with whomever you are speaking with, avoid any distracting activities such as typing or looking at your phone, and pay attention to their facial expressions and gestures so that you can react accordingly.

It is also important to engage in the conversation and ask questions to show that you’re truly interested. Starting out with simple, easy-to-answer questions is a great way to increase the comfort level of the speaker, and then you can move into deeper questions as the conversation goes on. Once the conversation has fully developed, you can demonstrate your understanding further by paraphrasing the other person’s ideas. This not only makes those you are speaking to feel fully heard, but it also allows them to correct any misunderstandings you may have.

## Authentic
##### !callout
“Authenticity… involves two parts: (a) who we say we are  and (b) what we do.” As such, you need to back up your words with your actions. This means taking great care in what you do and say to others.” - Better Conversations, Jim Knight, 2015
##### !end-callout
While you definitely want to be empathetic in a conversation, it is equally important to be open and honest.  People need to know they can trust what you are saying to them in order to fully engage with your ideas. This can be especially difficult when you find yourself disagreeing with someone else’s ideas, or if they take offense to any feedback you provide to them. 

The key in these situations is to remain assertive without being aggressive. Maintain neutral or positive body language, and focus on staying calm and non-threatening throughout the interaction. It is okay to negotiate, but always ensure that your idea is openly expressed. Clearly state your point of view, and remember to stay respectful but firm - being over apologetic or backpedaling creates uncertainty in the conversation. However, don’t confuse being firm with keeping an open mind- listen carefully to what the other person has to say in the conversation and feel free to change your mind- just ensure that your positions are readily apparent while you do so.  Also, be sure to avoid blaming others throughout the discussion- owning your ideas allows you to keep your credibility. Following these guidelines will ensure that the group can reach a workable solution- even if it’s more difficult in the short term.


## Technical Writing

As a programmer, it is important to learn how to keep your thoughts succinct and to the point when communicating with others. Keep the following tips in mind to effectively communicate with others.

**Keep in mind what the recipient already knows.**
When talking with someone, it can be difficult to avoid summarizing information they’ve likely already acquired from somewhere else. Avoiding this mistake not only saves everyone time, but also keeps the recipient’s attention focused on the most important part of your conversation. That being said, make certain not to skip over key ideas they may not have heard already. Think ahead about what they most likely already know, and don’t be afraid to ask if they know about a topic if you’re unsure.


**Discuss your ideas in an engaging manner.**
Communication is amplified when the recipient actively engages with what you are saying to them. If you know the person you are talking to well enough, try to relate the information to something they are familiar with. Allow time for them to respond to what you are saying, and ask them to paraphrase your main points at the end of the conversation.

**If appropriate, use supporting imagery.**
As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. When trying to communicate a complex idea, an image such as a graph or flow chart could help to foster understanding. Always think about what information you want to convey, and decide if an image would help you make your point.

**Simplify your language.**
Fancy wording is great for coming across more eloquently, but avoid using unnecessarily complex words when simple terminology will work. Also be sure to stay away from acronyms unless you’re certain everyone in your group is fully familiar with the term. Sometimes a well orchestrated point can be lost when a recipient is distracted trying to piece together what certain words mean without coming across as uninformed- help them avoid that stress altogether by keeping it simple.

* Keeping your statements brief and to the point.

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation
Correct! Technical writing focuses on keeping ideas clear, concise and as simple as possible. Therefore, keeping statements brief is ideal. Paraphrasing ideas is a great way to increase engagement with a speaker, and checks for overall understanding. Additionally, referencing a flowchart can really add clarity to complex ideas. However, reviewing required reading detracts from communication, as the team should already know that information unless they bring up specific questions or comments related to what was read. Finally, while utilizing technology based terminology isn’t necessarily a bad thing (so long as everyone understands the terms being used,) it is not necessarily relevant to technical writing.

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation
Correct! Maintaining eye contact, asking questions, and paraphrasing the speaker's main points all demonstrate that you are listening and actively engaged in the conversation. Furthermore, the questions and paraphrasing give you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of what they are saying and clarify any misunderstandings. While taking notes on your phone can be an active listening strategy, from the speaker’s point of view this can seem as though you are disengaged from the conversation. (Think of the scene in The Socercer’s Stone where Harry was carefully taking notes on the lecture, but professor Snape chastised him for not paying attention.) Oftentimes, you may even miss key parts of the conversation while you’re busy writing down others!

##### !question

Sarah and Miguel have been paired on a coding project together for most of the day, and things aren’t going well. They are struggling to keep up with the rest of the class, and now Miguel has stopped listening to Sarah’s suggestions as he types the code on his own. What’s worse, Sarah has been reading through the documentation and is certain that he’s coding things wrong. By the time class is over, both are feeling frustrated, and the project is due at the end of the day tomorrow. What are the **FIRST STEPS** Sarah should take to work to resolve this situation?

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Email the instructor that night about Miguel’s unacceptable behavior.
* Reflect on the situation, calm down and talk to Miguel in the morning.
* Calmly tell Miguel that he needs to allow her more input on the project.
* Apologize to Miguel for distracting him while he was working.
* Work on a separate project on her own.
* Prepare a plan for how to improve their workflow going forward.


##### !end-options

##### !answer

* Reflect on the situation, calm down and talk to Miguel in the morning.
* Calmly tell Miguel that he needs to allow her more input on the project.
* Prepare a plan for how to improve their workflow going forward.

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation
Correct! Sarah needs to remain assertive, without being aggressive, by clearly talking to Miguel about reestablishing the norms of paired programming. Taking time to calm down and reflect prior to the conversation is important here, as tempers are probably running high and you don’t want the situation to escalate. On the other hand, Sarah should not cede any ground by apologizing, as that confuses the message that she has a right to be a part of the project. Emailing the instructor and/or working individually are reasonable options if the conversation with Miguel proves ineffective, but it is best to attempt to work things out with the team individually before taking more drastic measures.
